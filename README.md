### Reflection
I believe the best way to learn a language is by listing what you want to achieve with the language in question and applying heuristics to it. Motivation serves as a great beneficiary in ensuring the learning experience is worthwhile. Reading documentation or already existing code (i.e., GH, GL, etc) in the language you want to learn is also beneficial. I take it upon myself to discover and share any resources I find useful in my journey in learning. I will try to update this repository from time to time. Without further ado let's get started!
